I was rant typing last night so not super paying attention. Though fun fact she really did brainwash the president to believe my friend was a pervert despite three years of seeing how good a person he was. What I mean by that is he would spew her nonsense when club members asked where my friend had gone to even if she wasn’t there to force him to say that.\n",

      "Reading what you wrote just really got to me. I have a lot of stories which get me pissed off at how much toxic feminism prospers in society and especially in the college scene. I only graduated college a year ago so I can remember these events extremely well. When I was in my third year my best friend was accused of rape because he rejected a girl who tried to force him to sleep with her and cheat on his girlfriend. Despite having no evidence, because there was none the police were investigating him for over a year simply because this girl said something happened that didn’t. He lost so much weight and developed really terrible anxiety because of it. It was like no matter how much he said it didn’t happen the police refused to accept it. They even got to the point where they were throwing out other claims based on her bullshit statement like he abused her even if he didn’t rape her and etc. He legit almost took a plea deal to try to make it all stop. This bitch meanwhile was playing victim and getting support from everyone, which in the end they concluded was the primary reason she kept it going so long, because she wanted attention. \n",
      "\n",
      "My second big example actually happened during the year after I graduated undergrad and now it happened at the gaming club which I founded, by my immediate successor and his crazy girlfriend who pretended to be the president over him. A different friend I have who is a super sweet guy and very inclusive saw that one of the female members was off in a corner on her own so he decided to be friendly and try to find an interest she likes. They talked about anime and music yada yada so when club ended he decided to friend her on FB so they could talk about the anime some more and she would feel she made a friend. She misinterprets it hard. Her immediate response is to report him to the club president who was probably going to just let it go until his girlfriend says my friend needs to be made an example of. She takes lead yelling at him and tells him things along the line of people like him are the type who kill girls who reject them and it was obvious he wasn’t just being nice but hitting on her and if he didn’t leave club they would call campus PD on him. I’m standing there mouth wide open while the new president doesn’t do anything but nod in agreement with her. This guy btw knows him as well for three years and was even invited to gaming club through my friend and he does nothing to defend my friends image to her, it really pissed me off to see that. I later found out it was because if he didn’t let her have her victory she wouldn’t sleep with him for awhile. I stopped talking to him in altogether after that. After that we lost over half the members and the ones that stayed dealt with her tranny over what was and wasn’t allowed to be said or done in club. I felt obligated to continue club because I started it but in the end I also had to quit because it never sat right with me what they did to my friend and what they were doing to my organization. My club is now in the hands of a weak willed president and his extreme feminist GF who hates when guys are nice to girls.\n",
