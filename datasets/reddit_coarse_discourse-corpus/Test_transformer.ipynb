By the end it could not be denied. Now I'm sure it helps that I'm a musician, since this created an immediate connection to the subject matter. I spent a portion of the movie with my Telecaster in my lap trying to play along with the characters who all seem to be really playing and singing these songs. However I also am *not* a fan of country western, so that could have easily been a turn off.  \\n\\nTo begin describing the action in the film is daunting. I can't even process a lot of what I saw. This movie is extremely dense, and the first 30 minutes or so are spent just trying to figure out who people are. Their relationships to one another - some of which are purely incidental - slowly become clear as things progress. It's an ensemble cast with no clear lead and lots of overlapping conversations. Some developments all tie together in the end. Some seem to be kind of loose ends. There is throughout, however, a very keen sense about people. These naturalistic performances are believable and so is the world they inhabit. It feels like a film that doesn't exaggerate - rather, it downplays some of the outrageousness which just makes it seem all the more outrageous. Consider for example Shelley Duvall's wig or Jeff Goldblum's entire character.  \\n\\nI feel I should mention this. Jeff Goldblum is in this film. He never speaks, and he is awesome.  \\n\\n*Nashville* is a musical. There is reportedly around an hour of music in its 150+ minute run time. I believe it. Sometimes these songs, most if not all of which are original, seem to speak pointedly to or about a character. Sometimes it's all about the shifts and glances in the audience. There are many memorable scenes, such as when a fragile country starlet spaces out on stage and begins rambling between numbers, or a disenchanted housewife waits at the back of a bar for a womanizing folk singer, or a poor deceived waitress is goaded into a striptease by a raucous crowd and still refuses to believe that she can't actually sing.   \\n\\nThis is rich film, a complex tapestry perfectly suited to a moment in time (the US Bicentennial) that seems as though it will reward additional viewings. I sometimes become fidgety during long movies but I was never bored with *Nashville*. It swept me along with its quirky and interesting characters to a climax that maybe I should have seen coming.  \\n\\n8/10\", 'meta': {'post_depth': 0, 'majority_type': 'announcement', 'majority_link': 'none', 'annotation-types': ['announcement', 'announcement', 'announcement'], 'annotation-links': ['none', 'none', 'none'], 'ups': 3, 'toxicity': 0.21341012}}),\n",

Made her laugh several times with corny jokes, introduced her to my grandma, and we all talked for a minute after I was done picking out the clothes I wanted and left. \\n\\n* Second set: was this older gal, mid 40\\'s. Wouldn\\'t give her an HB because it was more of just a casual chat about the outfit I put on. She said she didn\\'t like it, I responded with \"aw, I\\'m not attractive?!\" and she said \"I never said that haha\" and grinned. I gave her a wink as she continued laughing and went into her stall.\\n\\n* Third set:  **NUMBER CLOSE** As me and my Grandma are waiting in line to be helped checking out, and HB7 walks to the register and helps us. We IMMEDIATELY small talk. Exchanging intellectual talking points such as martyrs and assassinations, making her laugh with jokes, poking fun at her, transitioned to talking about movies, and she suggested I watch one. The Darjeeling Limited, I gave her a queer look, she then rolled out some receipt to write it down. I asked her to put her name down there too. She did, and then said \"Want my number so you can tell me when you watch it?\" I obliged her saying \"Yeah, that could work\". It was only after I got her number she even ACKNOWLEDGED my grandmother being ONE FOOT next to me the whole time! HAHA. She asked who she was, I said my Grandmother. Mind you I look completely white, and my grandmother is full Japanese. We talked for a bit about my grandma and the war, and how my grandma was bombed etc. Then I take my leave and text her about an hour later.
