Barack Obama set out to change the tone of US foreign policy. And he did. By virtue of his personal story, by dint of his not being George W.

Here is a president who acknowledges that we hold no monopoly on the legitimacy of our interests, who aspires to finding the common ground in resolving disagreements with friend and foe. His caution, his deliberativeness, his stated willingness to at least try to negotiate even with our bitterest enemies and to cool down the rhetoric \u2013 played so well out of the gate, that they gave him the Nobel Peace Prize \u2013 after just 262 days in office.

Seeking a new balance in America\u2019s dealings in the Middle East, Obama asked Israel to stop building settlements, but the building goes on.

Even when the stakes were less than life and death \u2013 his bid to bring the Olympics to Chicago \u2013 he was denied. Not that any of this is easy. And it may be that some of these more serious challenges would by now be more difficult still if Obama had not set a new tone. But might the opposite be true? Might our adversaries see the president\u2019s coolness as uncertainty and his deliberativeness as weakness? Can they exploit his affinity for common ground, by pushing to gain more ground for themselves? By acknowledging that all sides can have legitimate interests, as well as legitimate grievances, is the president yielding the high ground?
